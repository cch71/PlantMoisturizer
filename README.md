# Soil Moisture Reader

This is in its early stages and not meant to be pretty yet.  It is functional.

## Components

* SSD1306 Oled Display
* v2.0 Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
* Seeed Studio XAIO Esp32s3 Dev Board

## Future Plans

I did get a 4 piece kit with water pumps.  At some point, I plan on turning this into a full-blown
desktop irrigation system.  I also am planning on adding sensors for reading Pressure,
Temp, and a battery-backed clock.  It is pretty standard for a project like this and it is written
in Rust.
